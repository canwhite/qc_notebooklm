1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
While reading the diary of Emperor Rosel,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,960
Klein was deeply moved by the simplified Chinese characters

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,880
and the identity of the fellow-time traveler.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
In the diary, Emperor Rosel recorded crucial information

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,200
about potions, such as digestion and role-playing,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,610
which were invaluable to Klein.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,330
He yearned to find more diaries

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,610
to unlock the secrets of the mysterious realm.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,570
During a conversation with Old Neil,

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,970
Klein learned about the rarity of extraordinary events

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,530
and the preciousness of Rosel's diaries.

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,770
The two also humorously discussed the idea

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,570
of establishing a society for the protection

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,700
of magical creatures, easing the tense atmosphere.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,740
While collecting weapons and equipment,

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,060
Klein had a light-hearted exchange with Old Neil

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,580
but couldn't shake his fixation

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,340
on the contents of Rosel's diaries.

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,580
He regretted not asking more about sequences and potions,

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,220
but found new hope in his exploration journey

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,530
with the newly acquainted Night Watchman, Leonard Mitchell.

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,650
Klein returned to the reception hall,

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,850
where Rosel informed him that the captain asked him

24
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,660
to come back on Monday to handle personal matters first.

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,780
Grateful for this humane management,

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,100
Klein originally planned to inform the University of Tingen

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,020
that he would not attend the interview,

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,880
but now could leisurely go.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,200
He inquired about the starting sequence controlled

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,400
by the church, and Rosel was surprised

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,960
if he wanted to become an extraordinary being,

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,800
warning of the dangers.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,080
Klein explained he just wanted to understand common knowledge,

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,960
and Ros, whose father was once a Night Watchman, became excited,

35
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,760
but eventually revealed that the church's

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,480
starting sequence was sleepless, sequence nine.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,960
Klein learned that Captain Dunne was sequence seven nightmare,

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,210
one of only two in Tingen City.

39
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,970
Ros also mentioned other sequences like Seer and Medium,

40
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,930
and Klein was interested in Seer

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,630
as it aligned with his desire to explore mysterious knowledge.

42
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,670
Finally, Klein decided to treat his sister to a good meal

43
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,500
with his newly earned 12 pounds.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,900
Walking along Zotter Street,

45
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,100
Klein, with only three pence left,

46
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,300
decided to buy a cane to make change

47
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,860
for the four pence public carriage fare.

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,380
He entered the Virkel hats and cloak shop

49
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,010
and chose a moderately priced water soaked wood cane.

50
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,610
When paying, he tried to haggle but failed,

51
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,120
eventually leaving satisfied with his purchase.

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,240
Back at the apartment,

53
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,480
he practiced using the cane and revolver,

54
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,130
enhancing his sense of security.

55
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,370
When Melissa returned home,

56
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,530
Klein suggested going out to celebrate his new job,

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,450
despite Melissa's concerns about moving

58
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,130
and increased expenses.

59
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,260
Klein insisted on the start of a new life.

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,780
Klein and Melissa discussed moving matters,

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,300
with Klein emphasizing decorum and social rules

62
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,930
while Melissa cared about thrift in the future.

63
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,970
Klein eventually convinced Melissa,

64
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,010
planning to move to a townhouse with a private washroom

65
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,720
and mentioning waiting for Benson to return before acting.

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,040
Melissa mentioned her classmate Selena's brother

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,520
post-poning marriage for a stable life,

68
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,200
while Klein assured her of his stable salary,

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,440
not needing to worry excessively.

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,400
Then, Klein suggested a celebration,

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,540
and Melissa agreed but emphasized the need for thrift.

72
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,580
Klein bought ingredients and gave Melissa extra money

73
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,180
for fruit and lemon cake,

74
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,860
showing his care for his sister.

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,780
Klein went to the University of Tingen

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,540
to handle the interview matters,

77
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,660
appreciating the university environment

78
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,900
and reminiscing about his rowing experience.

79
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,260
He informed in advance that he would not attend the interview,

80
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,740
as he had found a job,

81
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,020
receiving congratulations

82
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,900
from the faculty member Haven Stone.

83
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,340
He coincidentally met his mentor Kern

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,100
and the faculty member Azeek,

85
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,020
discussing job choices in the case of Welch,

86
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,660
with Azeek feeling familiar with antagonists,

87
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,140
but unable to recall details.

88
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,180
Azeek and Quentin Kern discussed historical issues

89
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,180
and Klein expressed interest in the history

90
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,060
of the fourth epoch, requesting information from them.

91
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,540
Kern was satisfied with Klein's performance,

92
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,700
and as a guest for Klein's address,

93
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,740
learning he was about to move,

94
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,940
Kern reminded Klein to improve his living environment.

95
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,540
Klein inquired about reports on Welch and Nia,

96
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,660
but due to the tight meeting time,

97
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,740
Azeek handed the newspaper to Klein and left.

98
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,540
Klein read the newspaper,

99
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,580
finding reports on the Welch case,

100
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,500
with the police having identified the suspect.

101
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,540
He felt a sense of being watched

102
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,130
and decided to seek help at the church of St. Selina.

103
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,130
Inside the church,

104
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,930
he contacted Dunsmith through the confessional,

105
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,850
reporting being followed.

106
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,810
Klein followed the middle-aged priest

107
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,730
through a dimly lit corridor,

108
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,130
passing through heavily guarded passages,

109
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,300
and entering underground stone steps.

110
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,180
The priest indicated that the left path

111
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,820
at the crossroads led to the Charnis Gate

112
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,020
and Klein responded with religious rituals.

113
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,460
He descended alone,

114
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,180
turning back to see the priest standing like a wax statue,

115
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,740
continuing to the crossroads

116
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,380
and returning to the Black Thorn Security Company

117
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,550
without turning towards the Charnis Gate.

118
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,110
In the reception hall, Klein spoke with Rose,

119
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,380
learning the captain's location.

120
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,500
He found Dunn and reported being followed.

121
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,140
Dunn speculated it could be a private detective

122
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,580
hired by Welch's father

123
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,860
or someone seeking the antigenous family notebook.

124
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,740
Dunn advised Klein to return the same way,

125
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,100
doing anything he wanted,

126
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,930
but not scaring off the follower or breaking the law.

127
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,210
Klein returned to the church,

128
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,090
seeing the middle-aged priest again,

129
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,870
then left the church,

130
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,350
feeling persistent surveillance.

131
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,950
He suspected the follower had a dark past,

132
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,970
fearing the church.

133
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,890
Klein went to the Zotter shooting club

134
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,610
to practice his marksmanship,

135
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,530
enhancing his self-defense capabilities.

136
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,650
After practice, Klein returned home,

137
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,090
sharing the good news with his brother Benson.

138
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,290
He had found a new job

139
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,260
with a weekly salary of three pounds.

140
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,660
They decided to celebrate,

141
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,660
planning to buy ingredients together in the afternoon.

142
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,420
Klein expressed dissatisfaction

143
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,260
with the complex currency system

144
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,720
and Benson responded humorously, both laughing.

145
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Benson seriously rebutted,

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,880
no not one of them,

147
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,720
and Klein understood after a pause,

148
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,880
both laughing again.

149
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,960
Benson added,

150
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,040
a reasonable and simple currency system

151
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,840
requires knowing numbers and the decimal system,

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,800
but there are two few such talents among the big wigs.

153
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Klein and Benson had humorous interactions during dinner,

154
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,360
discussing the rental contract

155
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,330
and landlord Frank's intelligence.

156
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,010
Benson planned to visit the landlord

157
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,370
with Klein the next day to view the house.

158
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,250
After dinner,

159
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,530
Klein went to the market to buy ingredients,

160
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,170
feeling watched but not contacted.

161
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,570
Back home, he did simple exercises

162
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,370
and reviewed textbooks.

163
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,290
In the evening,

164
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,490
the three siblings enjoyed a hearty dinner

165
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,250
celebrating Klein's new job with a warm atmosphere.

166
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,810
After dinner, they cleaned up

167
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,610
and studied individually until late at night.

168
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,690
In his dream,

169
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,690
Klein received instructions from Captain Dunn

170
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,570
that someone had infiltrated his room.

171
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,410
Waking up,

172
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,990
he found a stranger searching through his things.

173
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,230
Klein's heart raced,

174
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,550
his body trembling,

175
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,670
momentarily losing focus.

176
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,470
The intruder's pause allowed him to regain his senses,

177
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,640
quickly reaching for the revolver under his pillow.

178
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,360
Klein's heartbeat accelerated,

179
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
facing the intruder,

180
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,360
he calmly grasped the revolver under his pillow,

181
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,270
aiming more to intimidate than to attack.

182
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,110
The intruder faced with the gun,

183
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,430
slowly turned around

184
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,950
and Klein remained calm,

185
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,620
guiding the intruder towards the door.

186
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,140
As the door half opened,

187
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,260
the intruder suddenly crouched and rolled,

188
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,220
the door slamming shut.

189
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,940
Then, the serene sound of poetry came,

190
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,940
allowing Benson and others to fall asleep again.

191
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,100
Klein realized his bullets were blanks

192
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,660
and patiently waited for the fight to end.

193
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,100
Soon, Dunn Smith announced the problem solved

194
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,140
and revealed the intruder was from the secret society

195
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,220
related to the Antigonus family notebook.

196
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,700
Dunn offered Klein the choice

197
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,780
to become an extraordinary being,

198
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,700
introducing three sequence nine options.

199
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,610
Seer, Corpse Collector, and Fortune Teller.

200
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,010
Klein showed interest in Seer and Fortune Teller,

201
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,370
especially the latter,

202
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,330
as Emperor Rozel had expressed regret about it.

203
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,530
Klein inquired about the abilities of Fortune Teller

204
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,810
and Dunn explained it involved astrology,

205
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,930
card divination, et cetera,

206
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,410
but lacked direct combat means.

207
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,570
Klein hesitated and Dunn advised him

208
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,060
to make a decision by Monday.

209
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,380
After returning home,

210
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,980
Klein's emotions settled,

211
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,500
reminiscing about the past

212
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,180
and eventually made his choice.

213
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,260
The next day, Klein discussed renting matters

214
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
with his family,

215
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,340
with Benson mentioning

216
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,780
the Tingen City Housing Improvement Company,

217
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,940
offering options for the lower middle class.

218
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,300
They went to the company,

219
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,700
where Scott greeted them

220
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,660
and introduced several unrented townhouses.

221
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,820
The siblings decided to view the house at Narcissus Street 2.

222
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,060
Narcissus Street 2, 4 and 6

223
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,340
were connected gray blue buildings,

224
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,460
with Mr. Scott leading Klein,

225
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,140
Benson and Melissa on a tour.

226
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,780
The living room was spacious,

227
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,020
the dining room connected to the living room,

228
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,220
the kitchen and washroom on the first floor,

229
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,100
and four bedrooms and two washrooms on the second floor.

230
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,340
Scott mentioned the rent and deposit

231
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,900
and Klein inquired about the purchase price,

232
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,220
learning it was 850 pounds,

233
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,220
feeling the pressure after mental calculations.

234
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,940
Benson successfully negotiated the rent to 12 shillings,

235
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,960
signing the contract and notarizing it.

236
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,400
The siblings returned to their old residents,

237
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,520
negotiating the least termination with Mr. Frank,

238
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,760
with Benson successfully convincing Frank

239
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,680
to accept compensation by citing rent increases

240
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,640
and finding new tenants.

241
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
Then, they bought formal wear and moved,

242
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,990
busy until evening.

243
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,630
The next day Klein dressed in new formal wear,

244
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,910
went to the Black Thorn Security Company,

245
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,590
discussing career choices with Captain Dunn,

246
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,930
ultimately deciding to become a fortune teller.

247
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,010
Dunn gazed at Klein, the silence conveying pressure,

248
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,530
but Klein firmly returned the gaze.

249
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,330
Dunn warned of the irreversible nature of potions,

250
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,010
and Klein responded with a smile,

251
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,810
respecting his inner choice,

252
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,280
firmly replying, fortune teller.

253
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,640
Dunn Smith and Klein exchanged glances,

254
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,320
a moment of silence followed,

255
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,400
and Dunn warned of the irreversible nature

256
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,120
of potion consumption.

257
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,600
Klein responded resolutely,

258
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,580
choosing the fortune teller, potion.

259
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,860
Dunn led him underground,

260
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,380
explaining the sources of mystical knowledge,

261
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,980
including exploration, divine blessings,

262
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,860
and dangerous whispers.

263
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,300
They reached the alchemy room,

264
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,100
where Dunn arranged for Old Neil to prepare the potion,

265
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,700
reminding Klein to be cautious.

266
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,820
Old Neil briefly described the potion preparation process,

267
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,860
emphasizing the precision of key ingredients.

268
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,780
Finally, Klein witnessed the birth of the fortune teller,

269
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,740
potion, feeling the mysterious gaze,

270
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,140
facing the deep blue viscous potion, Klein hesitated,

271
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,460
asking if a ritual or incantation was needed.

272
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,180
Old Neil humorously suggested a series

273
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,980
of relaxation activities,

274
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,340
eventually explaining these were just methods

275
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,980
to relieve tension.

276
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,700
Klein mustered his courage and drank the potion,

277
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,020
instantly feeling a cold, stimulating sensation,

278
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,900
his vision blurring, colors intensifying,

279
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,060
as if entering a world filled with light and illusions.

280
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,900
He realized he was still in place,

281
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,500
returning to normal through conscious descent,

282
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,620
but feeling his head swell and hearing mysterious whispers.

283
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,340
Old Neil guided him to control

284
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,140
the overflowing potion power through meditation,

285
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,020
and Klein successfully entered a meditative state,

286
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,070
feeling calm.

287
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,150
Old Neil then taught him clairvoyance

288
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,150
and Klein gradually mastered it,

289
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,910
seeing the aura colors of himself and Old Neil,

290
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,670
eventually discovering a pair of nearly illusory eyes

291
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,780
behind Old Neil, feeling dinging.

292
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,420
Old Neil demonstrated a ritual magic symbol

293
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,060
and Klein found it magical,

294
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,910
beginning to explore the alchemy room through clairvoyance.

295
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,870
He discovered that the materials of supernatural species

296
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,830
still had residual spirituality,

297
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,560
crucial for potion preparation.

298
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
Old Neil mentioned the root causes

299
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,160
of extraordinary beings losing control

300
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,200
and shared the formula for the corpse collector potion,

301
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,500
making Klein uncomfortable.

302
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,100
Klein wondered why he hadn't seen spirits,

303
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,140
and Old Neil explained that this was because

304
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,980
the headquarters of the Night Watch team

305
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,220
had many extraordinary beings,

306
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,050
not allowing spirits to wander.

307
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,330
Klein experienced eyebrow twitching and hallucinations,

308
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,650
and Old Neil explained this was a normal effect

309
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,850
of clairvoyance on new extraordinary beings,

310
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,250
teaching him how to exit the clairvoyance state.

311
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,770
After practice, Klein learned to open and close clairvoyance

312
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,060
by lightly tapping his eyebrows twice.

313
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,540
After overusing clairvoyance,

314
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,220
Klein felt extremely tired,

315
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,530
and Old Neil advised him to go home and rest.

316
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,810
After returning home, Klein slept,

317
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,690
waking up to check the time,

318
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,570
ensuring he hadn't missed the gathering

319
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,690
with the hanged man and justice.

320
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,410
He reviewed historical textbooks,

321
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,540
preparing for the gathering.

322
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,700
At the gathering time, he entered the temple

323
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,300
above the gray fog through a specific ritual

324
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,540
ready to communicate with the hanged man and justice.

325
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,180
In the dimly lit basement, Alaj Wilson gazed

326
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,780
at a mysterious black liquid in a bottle,

327
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,220
the liquid inside emitting the sound of waves

328
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,780
with fog writhing on the surface.

329
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,420
The time pointed to three,

330
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,060
and Alaj's eyes suddenly turned black,

331
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,300
deep red light then surged and gulfing him.

332
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,460
In the hall family's residence in Belkland,

333
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,780
Odelli locked her room door,

334
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,980
preparing to record the formula.

335
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,580
She eagerly looked at the mirror,

336
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,300
only to see deep red light erupt, swallowing her.

337
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,620
Above the gray fog in the temple,

338
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,460
deep red light gushed from both sides

339
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,510
of the bronze long table, forming two vague figures.

340
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,030
Odelli greeted Mr. Fool and Mr. Hangman

341
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,670
and Klein observed their auras,

342
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,430
finding that Mr. Hangman seemed to be

343
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,950
a powerful extraordinary being.

344
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,070
Odelli inquired about the reception of the ghost shark blood,

345
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,390
and Alaj thanked her,

346
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,890
preparing to inform her of the audience potion formula.

347
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,970
He emphasized the precautions for preparing the potion

348
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,940
and Odelli carefully recorded it.

349
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,860
Klein suddenly interjected,

350
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,260
proposing the concepts of digestion and role-playing,

351
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,740
deeply inspiring Alaj,

352
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,100
who considered it a precious hint.

353
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,820
Klein proposed a commission,

354
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,260
hoping to gather the secret diaries of Rozel Gustaf.

355
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,220
The secret diaries of Emperor Rozel

356
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,420
caught the attention of Mr. Fool.

357
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,460
Klein and Alaj discussed the interpretation of the diaries,

358
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,370
with Klein hinting that he might have a method of interpretation.

359
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,810
Odelli tried to imagine transferring the texts,

360
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,790
demonstrating Mr. Fool's mysterious abilities.

361
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,990
Klein explained the requirements of the audience potion,

362
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,130
emphasizing the importance of maintaining neutral observation.

363
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,130
Alaj shared news about the voyage of Admiral Ludwig,

364
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,290
while Klein revealed the secret society

365
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,090
losing the Antigonus family notebook,

366
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,010
sparking a discussion about the reaction

367
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,790
of the Church of the Goddess of Night.

368
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,470
Odelli shared practical tips

369
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,970
for social occasions and political pressure.

370
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,450
The entire exchange was filled with a mysterious

371
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,380
and information exchanging atmosphere.

372
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,300
Odelli discussed government chaos

373
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,740
and Klein proposed a civil service examination system.

374
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,370
Alaj mocked ministers as no better than baboons.

375
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,930
Klein explained the details of the examination,

376
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,130
and Odelli was surprised by the simplicity

377
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,290
and effectiveness of the plan.

378
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,450
The gathering ended,

379
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,690
and Klein pondered the issue of new members,

380
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,170
deciding to act cautiously.

381
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,410
He experienced the abilities of extraordinary beings,

382
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,050
contemplating the role of fortune teller.

383
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,130
Odelli recorded the potion formula,

384
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,410
planning to obtain the materials.

385
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,970
Alaj reflected on Mr. Fools' mystery.

386
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,930
Klein, under the scorching sun,

387
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,250
changed into plain clothes

388
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,770
and walked towards Welch's residence.

389
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,290
On the way, he recalled the circus trainer

390
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,290
and the Antigonus family notebook,

391
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,160
feeling heavy-hearted.

392
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,080
At the slin bakery, Mrs. Wynton's sweet iced tea

393
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,000
and casual chat lifted his spirits.

394
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,680
Continuing on, Klein felt the oppressive atmosphere

395
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,560
of the street, using clairvoyance

396
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,400
to discover the residence pessimistic emotions.

397
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,640
He decided to explore Welch's residence,

398
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
but found no notebook.

399
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,800
Then, he noticed the sign of the fortune telling club

400
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,440
and decided to explore it,

401
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,330
considering joining to enhance his fortune telling skills.

402
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,490
Klein arrived at the fortune telling club,

403
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,520
inquiring about fortune telling matters.

404
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,840
The receptionist introduced several members,

405
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,780
including the expensive hains and the beginner graces.

406
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,420
Klein chose graces,

407
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,970
despite the receptionist's reminder that he was a beginner.

408
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,170
Klein insisted,

409
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,370
and the two had a fortune telling session,

410
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,530
with graces offering a free exchange,

411
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,810
but Klein insisted on paying.

412
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,410
The fortune telling results showed

413
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,660
that the item Klein sought might not have been found by others.

414
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,820
Klein also noticed,

415
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,660
graces might have health issues

416
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,980
and advised him to see a doctor.

417
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,300
Leaving the club, Klein planned to join it

418
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,940
to better play the role of,

419
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,780
fortune teller.

420
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,780
He then went to the Black Thorn Security Company,

421
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,700
discussing the mystery of the antagonist family notebook

422
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,140
with Leonard.

423
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,620
Klein and Leonard discussed the possible fate of the notebook,

424
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,580
with Klein speculating it might be hidden

425
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,020
to prepare for future sacrifices,

426
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,140
while Leonard suggested it might be destroyed

427
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,700
to cover up evil.

428
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,060
Klein expressed dissatisfaction with Leonard's suspicions,

429
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,660
but Leonard shifted the topic,

430
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,820
asking about Klein's findings,

431
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,740
who said there were no new discoveries

432
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,780
and plan to change routes.

433
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,020
Klein went to the armory to collect bullets,

434
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,260
encountering rows and blight,

435
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,740
with rows curious about Klein becoming an extraordinary being,

436
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,340
and blight expressing awe for extraordinary beings.

437
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,620
Klein collected bullets and left with rows,

438
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,990
practicing shooting and physical training.

439
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,590
Back home, Klein discussed family finances with Melissa,

440
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,350
successfully convincing her to take public carriages

441
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,540
to save time for studying.

442
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,620
The next day,

443
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,980
Klein and Benson went to work separately,

444
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,260
with Klein encountering old Neil and rows at the company,

445
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,100
starting new mystical studies,

446
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,340
with old Neil teaching an interesting technique.

447
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,180
Klein was curious about Old Neil's mystical technique,

448
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,140
and Old Neil asked him to make two cups of coffee,

449
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,090
one with something bad.

450
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,540
Klein did so, adding sole dirt to one cup.

451
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,980
Old Neil used divination to confirm which cup was problematic,

452
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,820
and explained the principles of divination.

453
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,660
Klein became deeply interested in divination techniques,

454
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,830
deciding to apply for the purchase of divination tools.

455
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,710
Old Neil then began teaching Klein the basics of mystical studies,

456
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,430
including symbols and constellations.

457
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,790
After the lesson, Old Neil advised Klein

458
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,590
to practice more and meditate,

459
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,310
supporting his decision to join the Fortune Telling Club

460
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,970
to enhance his divination skills.

461
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,010
Klein decided to apply for the fees to join the club,

462
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,020
to better monitor potential cultists.

463
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,820
Finally, Old Neil expressed dissatisfaction

464
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,300
with the dirt Klein added to the coffee,

465
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,460
demanding he handle it immediately.
